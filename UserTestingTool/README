Hello there! Welcome to the UserTesting tool!

This mini-suite of scripts can help you understand more from your user tests.

If cv2 is not installed, you can install OpenCV on the terminal by typing:
`pip3 install opencv-python`

DIRECTORIES:
    app_screenshots - put the screenshots of your application's pages
    screen_recordings - put your screen recording videos.
    
    ---
    * generated_metrics - stores user testing timing data as .csv files.
                          (generates after running videoToMetricsConverter.py)
    * generated_plots - stores visualisations of user testing timing data.
                        (generates after running plottingMetrics.py)

    Feel free to change the names of any of the directories you want.

FILES:
    videoToMetricsConverter.py - generates metrics on which parts of an
                                 application a user visisted, and for how long.
    plottingMetrics.py - generate visualisations of the generated metrics.
    
TIPS:
    1. Please run videoToMetricsConverter.py BEFORE plottingMetrics.py.
    2. Please let me know if there are any issues using the tool.
       Ironically enough, I haven't conducted user testing for bug-fixes!
    3. If you're stuck, just type --help after the name of the program.
       i.e. python3 videoToMetricsConverter.py --help
       You'll see a whole swathe of optional parameters that you can change.

EXAMPLE USAGE:
    python3 videoToMetricsConverter.py app_screenshots screen_recordings
    python3 plottingMetrics.py app_screenshots generated_metrics

Thank you for trying my mini-suite out! - Harry
