Hello there! Right now, you're in app_screenshots.

Please put your app screenshots (as images) in this directory.
Please make sure that every UNIQUE screen is shown here. If it's not here, 
it won't be detected.

Please give them useful names: the output plots will use the filenames in this
directory. (e.g. home.png, settings.jpg, sign_up.jpeg, etc.)

The idea is that videoToMetricsConverter.py will check every image in this 
directory for a match against the current part of the video.

Thank you! - Harry
